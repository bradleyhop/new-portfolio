[live site at bradleysmith.tech](https://bradleysmith.tech)

My professional portfolio's source code. Built using Vue.js 2, Vuetify, and Vue
Router.

Namecheap handles the domain name, and Netlify hosts the live site. Netlify also
handles form submisssions, which triggers a service on Zappier to send the form
submisssion to my email account.

Note: I'm using Vuetify 2, which depends on Sass ~1.32; any newer version will
have many warnings during the build process.
